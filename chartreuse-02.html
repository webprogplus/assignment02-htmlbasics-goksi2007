        <b>Chartreuse is a color midway between yellow & green</b> that was named due of its resemblance to
        the green color of one of the French liqueurs called green chartreuse, introduced in 1764.
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        The French word <i>chartreuse</i> means "charter house". The monasteries that the monks of the
        Carthusian order (who started producing Chartreuse liqueur in 1764) live in, the first one of which
        was established in 1082 by Saint Bruno,
        
        are called charter houses because they were chartered—
        and given generous material support—by the Duke of

        Burgundy known as Philip the Bold when he took over the area in 1378. Philip the Bold's elaborately decorated tomb
        
        was initially installed at a
        Carthusian charter house when he died in 1404.

        <blockquote>See the 1930s version of “Chartreuse green” in the index and color samples, a color not<br>
            as green as the web color chartreuse, but greener than chartreuse yellow—actually it is<br>
            a representation of the actual color of green chartreuse liqueur. The first recorded use of<br>
            chartreuse green as a color name in English was in 1926.</blockquote>
