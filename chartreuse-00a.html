    <p>  Chartreuse (Yellow-green)
        <br>
        Chartreuse is a color midway between yellow & green that was named due of its resemblance to the green color
        of one of the French liqueurs called green chartreuse, introduced in 1764.
        <br>
        Etymology
        The French word chartreuse means "charter house". The monasteries that the monks of the Carthusian order
        (who started producing Chartreuse liqueur in 1764) live in, the first one of which was established in 1082 by Saint
        Bruno, are called charter houses because they were chartered—and given generous material support—by the
        Duke of Burgundy known as Philip the Bold when he took over the area in 1378. Philip the Bold's elaborately
        decorated tomb was initially installed at a Carthusian charter house when he died in 1404.
